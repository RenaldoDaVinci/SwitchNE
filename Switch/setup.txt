#This section is for the parameters that are universal to the experiments, do not change unless you know your stuff

#compliane current
CompI = 1E-6

#compliance voltage
CompV = 2

#voltage
Volts = 2


#############Evolution parameters##############

genomes = 5000

#genes correspond to the number of electrodes, should remain untouched
genes = 8

#devs is the number of devices installed 
devs = 8

#number of generations
generations = 1

#Set the tolerance value
tolerance = 0.8

#FOR THE FULL SEARCH/GENERAL EVOLUTION, WE SET ONLY ONE ELECTRODE AS AN INPUT AND ONE ELECTRODE AS AN OUTPUT

InputElec = 1
OutputElec = 5


#############IV curve parameters##############

#voltage in volts. Can only have same abs value for max and min
Vabs = 0.1
