#############Configure the parameters##############
#This section is for the parameters that are universal to the experiments, do not change unless you know your stuff

#compliane current in Amp
CompI = 10E-6

#compliance voltage in volts
CompV = 2

#voltage value used for the input
Volts = 2


#############Evolution parameters##############

#genomes, for the full search idk 5000? For the evolution try 10
genomes = 5000

#genes correspond to the number of electrodes, should remain untouched
genes = 8

#devs is the number of devices installed 
devs = 8

#number of generations, for the full search 1, for the evolution however many
generations = 1

#Set the tolerance value
tolerance = 0.8

#FOR THE FULL SEARCH/GENERAL EVOLUTION, WE SET ONLY ONE ELECTRODE AS AN INPUT AND ONE ELECTRODE AS AN OUTPUT


#############IV curve parameters##############

#voltage in volts. Can only have same abs value for max and min
#please don't screw this up for the room temp measurements

Vabs = 2
Vstep =0.05

#Even though device numbers are parametrised here, please don't change. It'll not be compatible with the daisy chained IC chips

genes = 8
devs = 8
